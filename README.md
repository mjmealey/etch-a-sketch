# etch-a-sketch
I had an amazing time making this project. I did have to get help a bunch but I was able to retain just about all of the information I took in. Seeing my javascript make something others can use for their creative desires is sublime to say the least. I plan on adding some more functionality to it in the near future, but for now I am satisfied.
