I had an amazing time making this project. I did have to get help a bunch but I was able to retain just about all of the information I took in. Seeing my javascript make something others can use for their creative desires is sublime to say the least. I plan on adding some more functionality to it in the near future, but for now I am satisfied.

I decided to add a lot more code to this project to allow for the user to seamlessly go from 16x16 to 64x64 grids with different colors alongside one that produces random colors. I hope to return to this project later on to optimize it for the user further.
